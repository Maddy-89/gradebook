Project Requirements:

We need an electronic grade book to read the scores of an individual student and then compute some statistics from the scores.

The grades are entered as floating point numbers from 0 to 100, and these statistics should show us the highest grade, the lowest grade, and the average grade. Now one of the biggest challenges you'll face in software development is taking requirements like this and turning them into code.
